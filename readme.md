# comp4007 - Smart Elevator
The smart Elevator system develop base on appkickstarter
Including 4 threading class - Thread_Server, Thread_kiosk_panel, Thread_Elevator_Panel, Thread_Central_Control_Panel

## The things that you guys need to do:

## test and run
1. cd SESTester_v1-2
2. java -jar SESTesterKickstartTester.ejb
3. run the appkickerstart

### Kiosk part
1. Make sure the panel connect to the main class
2. In Thread_kiosk_panel, finish the if else in line 28
3. Finish the Svc_Reply part that when info receive, update the panel.

### Elevator part:
1. Make sure the panel connect to the main class
2. In Thread_Elevator_Panel, finish the if else in line 39 and 45, who check which type of message should be send
3. In Thread_Elevator_Panel, finish the process in line 60, which will receive a job send by server, and reply the information your all things need in line 63 to 66
4. Do the function that to update the panel of elevator as u like! (since i believe that you already have your own idea to design it)

### Admin part:
1. Make sure the panel connect to the main class
2. In Thread_Central_Control_Panel, TimesUp case, you should check the stop/start btn click or not, and send me back the Admin_Alert, just modify as you like, remember to take a look of elevator status in the readme.md
3. In Thread_Central_Control_Panel, Admin_Reply, these the message that server send all info of all elevator, just update this info in to the admin panel, modify it as u like

### All
1. please test it to make sure the program is runnable after modify the code.
2. GUI is not a must in Elevator and Kiosk, finish all the code part first
